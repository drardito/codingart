## Coding Art

### Overview
The goal of this 8 hour program is to provide rich experiences for high school students in using computer programming tools to create multimedia art. This will involve both block-based and text-based coding languages such as [TurtleArt](https://www.playfulinvention.com/webturtleart/), [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu), [Python](https://www.python.org), and [Processing](https://processing.org). 

Through these experiences, students will develop proficiency in some core computational thinking and computer science skills such as: debugging, algorithms, decomposition, pattern recognition, conditionals, procedures, and more.

### Session 4 (2 hours)

The goal of Session 4 (our last session) is to deepen our work from last week to create music using Snap! via TuneScope. In our first session on TuneScope, we explore *rhythms*, *instruments*, *notes*,  and *motifs*. In this session, we will explore coding music with more complexity, using *chords* and *chord progressions*.

Here is an outline for this  session:

- **Welcome Back** 
- **Previously On**
  - Review of TuneScope
  - [Rhythms, notes, instruments, motifs](https://maketolearn.org/creating-art-animations-and-music/drum-machine/)
  
- **Diving Deeper into music in Snap! via TuneScope [Module 7](https://maketolearn.org/creating-art-animations-and-music/playing-chords/)**
  - Chords and chord progressions
  - Combining rhythms, motifs, and chords in interesting and fun ways.
  - Showing off what we have learned and discovered.

- **Introduction [TuneScope](https://maketolearn.org/music/)**
  - *What's **TuneScope**?*
  - [*Music and Art as Code*](https://maketolearn.org/creating-art-animations-and-music/)
- **Wrapping Up**
  - What are we walking away with?
  - What's next?
