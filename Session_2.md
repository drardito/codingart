### Overview
The goal of this 8 hour program is to provide rich experiences for high school students in using computer programming tools to create multimedia art. This will involve both block-based and text-based coding languages such as [TurtleArt](https://www.playfulinvention.com/webturtleart/), [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu), [Python](https://www.python.org), and [Processing](https://processing.org). 

Through these experiences, students will develop proficiency in some core computational thinking and computer science skills such as: debugging, algorithms, decomposition, pattern recognition, conditionals, procedures, and more.

### Session 2 (2 hours)

The goal of Session 2 is to deepen our understanding of Snap! and how we can use more complex coding to create art. We will dive deeper into Snap! and then explore Python's **Turtle** library to make art.

Here is an outline for this  session:

- **Welcome Back** 
- **Previously On**
  - Review of Snap!

- **Diving Deeper into Snap!**
  - ***Libraries*** of costumes, sounds, backgrounds, etc.
  - Having one action ***trigger*** another action
  - Adding randomness to our coded art by adding ***conditions ***and ***variables***.

- **Introduction to Python Turtle Graphics**
  - *What's a Turtle?*
  - *Python Turtle Graphics*
- **Wrapping Up**
